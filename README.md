# Telecom Churn Analysis – Power BI, SQL & Machine Learning Integrated Project

A complete end-to-end **Data Analytics and Machine Learning** project that analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python (ML models)**. The project focuses on identifying key churn drivers and visualizing them effectively for business decision-making.

---

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn is a critical KPI in the telecom industry. This project integrates **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **machine learning** to understand churn behavior and predict which customers are likely to leave the service.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for business insights  
- **SQL** – For data extraction and transformation  
- **Python** – For ML model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)  
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib** – For data processing and modeling  
- **DAX** – Measures and KPIs in Power BI  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For ML experimentation

## 🤖 ML Model Summary

- **Objective**: Predict churn based on customer behavior
- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~80% (can vary)
- **Important Features**:
  - Tenure
  - Monthly Charges
  - Internet Service
  - Contract Type

---

## 🔍 Insights Derived

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.
- **Fiber optic users** have higher churn rates than DSL.
- **Longer-tenured customers** are less likely to leave.
- **Tech support** and **online security** influence retention.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the Power BI file (`Telecom Churn Dashboard.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
2. Run the SQL queries (if needed) on the raw dataset.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook in the ML_Python folder to explore model training and results.
